# VEOS-H7
VEOS alpha (SDOS) for STM32H7

Back when SDOS was called VEOS (Vehicle Embedded Operating System).

Somehow even worse than the F7 version. The kernel runs on the M7 CPU and the M4 CPU does something weird which freaks out the OS.
It needs to be re-written to support dual-core architecture and that's not a priority at the moment.
